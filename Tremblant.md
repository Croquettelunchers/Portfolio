This is my favorite shot of them all, despite the fact it was taken for documentation purposes to show how transparent objects (curtains) needed special treatment; to be on their own layer.

Unity's HDR-compatible shader (also known as **Skybox material**) is extremely rudimentary, so I thought good to craft a more potent one. This is a lot more important than it seems for 2 reasons:  
1. Archviz clients aren't just selling space, in most cases, they're selling *a view*   
2. HDRI have a huge impact on ambiant lighting.  
They would likely not provide proper HDRI, but stitched-up drone images, so we had to consider the worst of inputs and scales.
