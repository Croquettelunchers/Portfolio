# Lighting

> Done in **Unity** using in-house lighting tools.

<br/> 

I did cameras, lighting, materials, lots of shaders and post-process works on this project.

It was the first outside of the prototype box to use **physicaly-based lighting** for an actual client, it was exciting to work on.  
I think I went back and forth on the fog curve like 12 times. We must have retoned the trees like, 4 times.  
This was going to set the trend for so many future projects to come.  

Fun fact about the background is that we have good tools and shaders to provide fully textured background buildings but clients rarely ever want to pay for it.
