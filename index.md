Hi! I'm a lighting and Technical artist.  

I was rigging models in my basement with my 3D artist college degree and then one day I was swept into the wonderful world of Archviz.  
I made a lot of buildings, of course, but more importantly I ended up working on shaders, cameras, lighting, VFX, performances, assembling scenes and some tools.

Then I had the chance to work solo-dev on a few projects

I'm very excitable about a few things:  
- working in game engines, any in-engine job
- stylization, or look-dev
- tasks that make me say "ah!, it's working!"

I get hyped by all sorts of minor improvement in the pipeline, and I've told my programmers quite a few times that "it doesn't matter that it was easy, it is well done and we'll appreciate working with this for years"
