I was rigging models in my basement with my 3D arts college degree and then one day I was swept into the wonderful world of Archviz.  
I made a lot of buildings, of course, but more importantly I ended up working on **shaders**, **cameras**, **lighting**, **VFX**, **performances**, **tools** and assembling scenes (placing props, making things nice and cozy etc.)  

Then I had the chance to work solo-dev on a few projects with the people from Tobo Studio.  
That required me to learn how to fix a lot of software and hardware related issues.

That required me to learn how to fix a lot of software and hardware related issues like:
- preventing laptops from overheating,  
- building apps for VR,  
- compensating for fisheye lens chromatic aberation,  
- Windows 11,  
- My favorite: Finding out an external USB numpad is sending alphanumerical signals.  
-->
I'm very excitable about a few things:  
- working in game engines, any in-engine job.  
- stylization, or look-dev.   
- tasks that make me say "Yes! it's working!"

I'm currently living in Montreal.
