Hi! I'm a **lighting** and **Technical artist**.  

I was rigging models in my basement with my 3D artist college degree and then one day I was swept into the wonderful world of Archviz.  
I made a lot of buildings, of course, but more importantly I ended up working on **shaders**, **cameras**, **lighting**, **VFX**, **performances**, assembling scenes(placing props, making things nice and cozy etc.) and some **tools**.

Then I had the chance to work solo-dev on a few projects.  
That required me to learn how to fix a lot of software and hardware related issues like:
- preventing laptops from overheating,
- building apps for VR,
- compensating for fisheye lens chromatic aberation,
- Windows 11 losing midi inputs,
- My favorite: An external USB numpad sending alphanumerical signals. 

</br>
I'm very excitable about a few things:  </br>
- working in game engines, any in-engine job.  
- stylization, or look-dev.   
- tasks that make me say "ah!, it's working!"
