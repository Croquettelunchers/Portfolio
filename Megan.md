## Wanna play some Megan, man?
Megan is a fun little pixelart platformer project that I use to test whatever comes to mind.  
It was never intended to be a portfolio piece, but here we are.  
Aseprite and Pixly were used to create the sprites.  
Most of the code was done using visual scripting in Unity.  




give it a spin!
