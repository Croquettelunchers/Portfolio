## Wanna play some Megan, man?
Megan is a fun little pixelart platformer project that I use to test whatever comes to mind.  
This was never meant to be a portfolio piece (but here we are). It was designed to quench **The Thirst**, the thirst for making games.

> **Aseprite** and **Pixly** were used to create the sprites.  
> Most of the code was done using visual scripting in **Unity**.  

## Technical features:
> Here are some of the interresting technical features in the game.

### Pooling
Megan's trail rendering is composed of pooled objects to avoid the unnecessary CPU burden of repeatedly creating and destroying lots of objects.  
Here is how I approached the feature:
1. A Parent Gameobject hosts the trail mimics
2. A Trail Function sends Events to the Trail Mimics
3. The system runs on a shared FINISH ME HERE

As long as the Trail Function is present in the desired state of the state machine, the trails will spawn

Monobehaviors, visual script machines in my case, on the Trail Mimics manage the effect 

the effect can easily be restyled by simply changing the effect bloc. 

The objects themselves arent deactivated, to allow direct targetting, their renderer is disabled instead.

I'm challenging myself to avoid direct double jumps and walljumps.   
The Charged Shot is intentionnaly constrained in favor of environmental weaponry.  
There is a lot of feedback on most actions, that is to convey weight and
